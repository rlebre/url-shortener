# URL Shortener

URL Shortener is a small project that allows authorized users to shorten their long URls. Users may get a random 4 alphanumeric identifier of their links or, alternatively, provide a custom slug. The effectiveness of the short URL goes live after the e-mail confirmation.

The project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
